please construct and analyze the performance of a portfolio that fits the
following description:

   b. Rebalances the portfolio to equal weight each security in the
      portfolio at the beginning of each month
   c. Reinvests dividends into the securities that paid them
   d. Midway during the time period, (12/31/19), the portfolio replaces
      AGG with SHV during an otherwise normal rebalance

   d. Sortino Ratio (vs. a benchmark of your choice)
   e. CAPM Beta (vs. a benchmark of your choice)
   
In your deliverable, please provide:

      this context.
